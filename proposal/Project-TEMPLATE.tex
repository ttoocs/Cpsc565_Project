\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
%Give an introduction to why you have chosen this project. Why is it of interest to study what you propose to explore in your project? 
%
%References are added through a bibliography file (e.g., References.bib), so that one has easy access to referenced items \cite{Alon:1999aa}.
%Cause we can and want to.
We chose this project because all members of the group are interested in this type of simulation. We want to observe how an ecosystem evolves over time based on some controllable initial conditions, as we want to see how much the evolution of organisms is determined by the environment and how they are influenced by it.

\section{Related Work}
If you are aware of related work or similar work that has been done before, you should describe and mention it here. Here is also the place to refer to any papers, articles, web sites, etc. where you got your inspiration for your project from.
Critterding, and many other projects for evolution.

\section{Project Details}
We will start with evolution on basic creatures by adding/removing body parts with varying characteristics. An example of this, would be a mouth, which could be specialized to be better at eating plant matter, or meat.

\section{Software Tools}
%Mention the software tools you are going to use to implement your project. Be specific, i.e., add proper references.
Initial we are planning to attempt this in Unreal Engine, as it supports Linux and is open source, however failing that, we will be using Unity.
As for models, we are planning on either very basic ones, using blender to create some, or possibly using some Creative Commons or other freely licensable material.

\section{Time line}
%Give an approximate time line for the implementation of your project.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mouth, movement.
\item World.
\item Food-spawn.
\item A creature.
\item Multiple creatures.
\item Hope there's evolved behaviour.
\end{enumerate}
